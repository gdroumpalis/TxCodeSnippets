# TxCodeSnippets
Snippets for visual studio

Code snippets for Visual Studio.

This project contains category folders for all types of snippets in Visual Studio.
The names of every single snippet is a result of the first lower letter of the name of the folder.
For example if you want to use a snippet to create classes the first letter of your snippet shortcut is "c" to virtually sellect the folder that contains all the snippets to create Classes. 

The next letter of the shortcut depends from the action you want to complete. If for example you want to create a class that 
has a access modifier the next letter of the shortcut is goint to be "m" from the word modifier, to complete the shortcut you simply add the letter "c" to create a class with an access modifier. The complete shortcut now is "cmc". If you want to create a generic method in your class you press the letter "c" from the first letter of the name "classes" which is the folder that contains all the snippets for the classes the you choose again the letter "c" and then the letter "m" from the first letter in the word "method". Now you shortcut is "ccm". 

You can see that the first letter of your shortcut must always be the first letter of the name of the folder that contains the
wanted snippets.
